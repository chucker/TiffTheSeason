Desktop pictures based on Apple seasonal products (watch bands, phone cases, â€¦)

Do you wish your Mac's desktop picture popped like an Apple Watch Solo Loop? Or felt classy like an iPhone 11 Pro Leather Folio?

What if it looked more like these?

Apple has been releasing accessories (bands for the Apple Watch, cases for iPhones and iPads, etc.) on a semiannual schedule; spring and fall fashion collections, if you will. Many of those are great colors â€” why not have them on your Mac?

# Install

1. Download the latest release.

The zip file contains folders of single-color images, organized by releases of Apple accessory collections, and by material (either leather or silicone), e.g. `2019-fall-silicone` for all colors of silicone bands and cases.

2. Open System Preferences, Desktop & Screen Saver.

3. Drag one or more folders from the zip archive in the left panel, or add by clicking the **+** button:

This will add those folders to, well, the **Folders** section. And then you can simply pick one:

That's it! You pick a lovely color there. ðŸ™‚
